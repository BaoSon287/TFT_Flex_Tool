TFT Flex Tool is a Teamfight Tactics composition optimization tool built to support two separate playstyles: All-In (Silver Tier Augment) and Ryze Runic compositions.

For All-In (Silver), the tool focuses on maximizing early and wide trait activation. The solver prioritizes Origin traits over Class traits in order to activate as many synergies as possible with a limited number of units, making it well suited for aggressive tempo strategies and flexible board transitions.

For Ryze Runic compositions, the tool is designed to explore flexible team structures centered around Ryze’s runic trait system. It supports emblem-based customization and allows players to experiment with non-standard trait distributions instead of relying solely on fixed meta compositions.

The solver searches through possible team combinations under user-defined team size and time constraints. It supports forced champions, banned champions, and custom emblem values, providing a controlled environment for theorycrafting and optimization.

This project is intended as a practical tool for players who want to systematically explore team compositions when playing All-In Silver augments or Ryze Runic boards, reducing reliance on manual trial and error and enabling more informed decision-making.
